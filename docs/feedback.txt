## Feedback form for CSE Many-Core Course 360.252

# Content

* Did the course content match your expectations?

* Which subject(s) did you find particularly interesting or relevant (if any)?

* Which subject(s) did you find less interesting or relevant (if any)?

* Which content should be added or removed (if any)?


# Exercises

* How do you rate the difficulty of the exercises?

* How do you rate the time required to complete the exercises?

* Which additional features should the online code execution platform have?

* A possible alterative is the following:
  The online platform could automatically verify submissions against a test set and provide immediate feedback.
  Thus, students would tweak their code until the system accepts the solution(s).
  No report would have to be written, so the exercise will be focused on the code only, but not on summarizing and communicating the obtained results.
  What do you think of such a system? Good? Bad?
 

# Misc

* If you were to hold the lecture next winter term, what would you change?

* Is there anything else that you want to share to enhance future editions of this course?
